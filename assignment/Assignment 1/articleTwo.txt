==== AGENT

American Express (AmEx)

==== GOAL

Two areas where this is evident are detecting fraud, and bringing merchants and customers closer together.

==== DATA

AmEx collected a variety of data sources, including card membership information, spending details, and merchant information.
 
==== METHODS

On the merchant side, American Express is offering new online business trend analysis and industry peer benchmarking to help companies see how they’re doing compared to their competition. The data is anonymised, meaning any personally identifiable data is stripped out of the transactions, but merchants are able to see detailed trends within specific niche markets or customer segments.

==== RESULTS

AmEx is on the leading edge of integrating data and machine learning into its business model and practices to the benefit of the company and its end users. Its commitment to Big Data, analytics and machine learning is something any company can learn from. It’s also worth noting that other credit card companies such as MasterCard and Visa are applying similar technologies, and it looks as though data and analytics are at the forefront of their competitive forces. Whichever company will leverage data in the most effective way will win in this highly competitive environment.  

==== COMMENTS

In my opinion I found that AmEx are using machine learning very effectively by benefiting both consumers and merchants.
